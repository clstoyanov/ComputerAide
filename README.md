Helper for elderly people to use computers

This app was created by Christian Stoyanov. A 23 year old student living in the Netherlands.

The goal of this app is to help elderly people learn how to use the basics of their computer,
along with other common apps.

The origin of this idea was from me living abroad and not being able to physically help my
grandma with her laptop. That's why there are troubleshooting parts. So, by having an app she
can open whenever she wants to help her with something when I'm not there, will benefit us both.

I still have some more videos to record as you can tell by the functionless buttons.
